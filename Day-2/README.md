# Operators in Python

## Floor Division
The floor division operator (//) is used to perform division where the result is rounded 
down to the nearest whole number. This is also known as integer division or division that
returns an integer, since the result will always be an **integer** even if the division would
normally result in a fraction.

## F-String
Used to convert the datatypes to string. It provides a convenient way to embed 
expressions inside string literals, using {} brackets to evaluate expressions. 
The letter "f" before the string indicates that the string is an f-string.
